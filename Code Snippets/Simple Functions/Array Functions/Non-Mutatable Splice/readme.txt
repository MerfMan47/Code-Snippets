This is a function I used in a Code Wars where
the goal was to remove a specific element from
an array without mutatuing the origonal array.
Of course splice was not an option so instead
I mimicked what splice does with a function and
several uses of the slice method on each side
of the element that needed to be removed.
Might be useful later.
